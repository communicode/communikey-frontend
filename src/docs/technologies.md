The package ecosystem [npm](https://npmjs.com) is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

The currently tested and supported version is [{{book.technologies.node.version}}](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v6.5.0).

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react) is the [reactive](http://reactivemanifesto.org) JavaScript library used to build the interactive and declarative UI components. It manages application states and efficiently updated and renders just the right components when data changes. The design pattern is to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs with the ability to easily pass rich data through the application and keep state out of the DOM.

The currently tested and supported version is [{{book.technologies.react.version}}](https://npmjs.com/package/react).
